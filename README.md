# Notes-withDB
Hi, this my first posted Andriod app. 
For now it's just simple notes with database. Here I'm using Navigation, Lifecycle and Room Components. I choose to create one activity using Kotlin, beacause this is rigth way to start development in 2022 year.
This is not a final product, but it is a start point of development app "KARTOVED".
